# Air Quality Visual Map

## Project Description
The Air Quality Visual Map project is designed to provide a guide on how to access and use the Air Quality Visual Map API. This API enables users to retrieve live air quality data for various locations and visualize it on a map.

## Data Source
We fetch live air quality data using the AQICN Gaia API. This API provides up-to-date information on Air Quality Index (AQI) scores, which is a standardized index used to communicate air pollution levels to the public.

## Required Packages
To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

1. **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
2. **folium**: A library for creating interactive maps.

Ensure you have these packages installed in your Python environment before using the project.

- [Interactive Plotting Stations](https://rickdaalhuizen.com/air-quality-analysis/plotting-stations.html)

This project aims to make real-time air quality information accessible and understandable, utilizing the Air Quality Index (AQI) to categorize air quality conditions and provide valuable insights to the public.
